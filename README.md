# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis — Superstore Dataset

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance using the **Superstore dataset**. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights through **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualization** using **Excel**, **Python**, and optionally **Power BI**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To identify trends, customer behavior, top-performing products, loss-making areas, and regional sales performance — while learning how to use different tools (Excel, Python, Power BI) for real-world data analytics workflows.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning, PivotTables, and chart visualizations  
- **Python** – Pandas, Matplotlib for data analysis and EDA  
- **Power BI** *(optional)* – For interactive dashboard creation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For scripting and experimenting with Python code

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. 🔍 Data Cleaning (in Excel & Python)
- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., `Row ID`)
- Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to proper datetime formats
- Created new columns: `Order Year`, `Order Month`
- Trimmed white spaces, handled inconsistencies
- Verified null values (none found)

> ✅ Cleaning in both Excel and Python allowed better understanding of workflow differences.

### 2. 📋 Dataset Structure

Key columns include:
- **Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit** – for financial metrics  
- **Category, Sub-Category, Product Name** – for product-level analysis  
- **Region, State, City** – for geographic segmentation  
- **Segment, Customer Name** – for customer behavior insights  
- **Order/Ship Dates** – for time-based trends

### 3. 🎯 EDA Goals

Based on domain knowledge and AI-guided suggestions:
- Identify **top-performing categories/sub-categories**
- Analyze **regional sales and profitability**
- Assess impact of **discounts on profit**
- Discover **monthly/yearly sales trends**
- Examine **segment-wise performance**
- Find **low-performing states/cities/customers**

---

### 4. 📊 EDA in Excel

Used **PivotTables** and **Charts** to:
- Analyze **Sales by Region**
- Correlate **Discount vs Profit**
- Compare **Category/Sub-category performance**
- Track **monthly revenue/profit trends**
- Visualize **segment distribution**

> 💡 Excel proved highly intuitive and fast for small to mid-scale business analysis.
